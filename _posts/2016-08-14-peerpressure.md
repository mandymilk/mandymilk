# Peer Pressure VS Culture Pressure
Peer Pressure is not a kind of culture/society pressure. It exists in every culture, every society. However, cultural pressure doesn't.

Last week, I talked with one of my colleagues about her recent pressure of getting married. Actually it's her anxiety of finding a boyfriend. She is the same age with me. We were born in 1990, which has the largest newborn population in China. She thought she was facing a lot of pressure from her friends and colleagues. Because most of them have got married. It made me think that whether it's because most of my friends haven't got married which made me avoid being so nerve-wracking.

In fact, although I am still feeling OK with the marriage thing, I do feel a lot of pressure when it comes to the career. Many of my friends works in the big internet company. When we talk about the life in Alibaba or Tencent or Baidu, the pressure naturally comes to being. I know we are not focused on who is better instead of wishing we each other can be a better person in every aspect to make the friendship better.

When I was first thinking about these issues. I ascribed it to the peer pressure. When I had a morning talk with my oral English teacher, I realized these were not merely peer pressure or to some extent they cannot be defined as peer pressure. The culture pressure actually needs to account for the feelings or pressure. 

For some people in other countries, the girls or boys born in 1990 usually don't feel so eager to get married. Because parents or society didn't think you are not so good so that you cannot find a good girl or boy. The society holds a different opinion towards marriage. 
As a matter of fact, the first time I felt some pressure about the marriage thing was when I graduated from the graduate school and went back hometown to visit my high school teacher. He asked me in a very strange voice, 'Why don't you find a boyfriend to get married?' He was the big supporter for me to go to the graduate school and always encouraged me to go abroad to study. Still he has the opinion that girls should get married before 25-year-old. You see he is not old-fashioned or some stubborn old man. He is just 35 and he receives good high education. It has nothing to do with education or something like that, it's just the concept the whole society holds.

It is the similar reason for the career pressure maybe. We have very narrow insight of success. So we defined 'better' in a narrow way. I knew some friends who chose to be independent photographer, freelancer and other jobs that cannot bring so much money or fame. I admire them but I still feel the pressure to be a better job market creature. 

When we talk about peer pressure, which actually exist in every culture, it doesn't have a big difference in different country or culture. And most of the time it exists among the teenagers. The scene often becomes that ' if you don't smoke, you are not cool','if you don't have sex in the senior high school, you are not cool', 'if you don't  go hooky, you are not cool'. 

Maybe the similarity between peer pressure and culture pressure is that both are unavoidable. The thing we can do is to say no to the 'false' cool but live in a real cool way to respect the individuality of ourselves.
